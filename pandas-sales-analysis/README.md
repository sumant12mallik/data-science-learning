This project is part of my Data Science learning journey.

In this project, I used the Pandas library to analyze sales data in a structured way.

## What I Learned
- Creating a DataFrame using Pandas
- Performing data analysis without manual loops
- Calculating total, average, min, and max values
- Filtering data based on conditions
- Counting specific values like zero-sales days

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas

This is a beginner-friendly data analysis project showing how real-world data can be handled efficiently using Pandas.
