This project demonstrates how a single Python logic can be reused to analyze multiple datasets.
Concepts covered include loops, condition handling, data validation, summary statistics, and insight generation.
The focus is on writing reusable logic instead of rewriting code for every dataset.
Skills used: Python, loops, conditional logic, data analysis thinking.
