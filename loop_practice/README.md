# Nested Loop Practice with Multiple Datasets

This project demonstrates how to analyze hierarchical sales data using Python.

## Concepts Covered
- Nested dictionaries (Region → Branch → Sales data)
- Nested loops for multi-level data traversal
- Data cleaning (handling negative and zero values)
- Reusable functions for analysis
- Business insight generation from raw data

## Dataset Structure
The dataset is organized as:
Region → Branch → List of daily sales values

## Key Features
- Calculates total, average, minimum, and maximum sales
- Categorizes sales into low, mid, and high ranges
- Generates meaningful insights based on data patterns
- Designed in a reusable and scalable way

## Use Case
This kind of structure is commonly used in real-world data analysis where data is grouped by geography, department, or category.

## Tech Stack
- Python (Core)
- Dictionaries & Loops
- Clean coding practices
