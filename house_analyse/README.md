📊 Day 3: Housing Data Analysis (Python)
🔍 Project Overview
This project is part of my Data Science learning journey.
In this project, I analyzed housing price data using Python to understand data distribution, clean invalid values, and generate meaningful insights.
🧠 What I Did in This Project
Ignored negative values (data cleaning)
Counted zero and positive values
Calculated:
Total
Average
Minimum & Maximum
Categorized data into:
Low
Medium
High
Generated insights automatically based on data patterns
Created branch-wise reports using functions
🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 🐍
Basic programming concepts:
Loops
Conditions
Functions
Lists & Dictionaries
